### 🎯 Goal

The objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning classification models to predict an insurance-related target variable.
The project follows a complete and structured ML pipeline, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

This work was developed as a final project for a Machine Learning course.

### 🧪 Methodology

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analysis of feature distributions
- Investigation of missing values
- Examination of class imbalance in the target variable

#### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Train–test splitting


### 🤖 Models and Evaluation

The following classification models were implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were applied to ensure robust performance.

### ✅ Key Outcomes
- Comparison of multiple classification algorithms
- Identification of the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics
- Insights into how different modeling approaches behave on the same dataset
